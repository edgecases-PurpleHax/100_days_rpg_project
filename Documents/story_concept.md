# Era concept
* Possibilities (WIP)
  * Futuristic?
  * Medieval?
  * Maybe time jumping? 
* How does the player get around?
* How does the player meet NPCs and Enemies?
* This will define what type of healing and such
  * Potions: Medieval
  * Syringes, shots, etc Futuristic
  * Mix of both for time jumping
